1)  Django provide ---O.R.M--- (Object Relational Mapper) functionalities This allows
    one to work with different databases in object oriented way thus providing a pre
    given syntax to perform actions also we need not to learn sql codes everytime


2)  Migrations are useful inorder to alter the database table after its creation

3)  Since we are not makng registration form instead we r using an object
    of it provided by django.contrib.forms thus we need to add extra fields to
    form by ourselves by creating new form inherting usercreationform
    and add required fields on that


4)  Django provides us with class based views which are in
    django.contrib.auth.views
    some are LoginView, LogoutView etc.
    as_view() method for this views tells us for path for our form
    This type of form take care for our logic but not the template.

5)  IN settings.py at bottom
    a) LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL this setting change the default page which will open when we logsin
    b) LOGIN_URL this setting will tell which url must be open if a view is caalled which
       is decorated with login_required

6)  In Django User table is created by its own once we create an admin

7)  CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap4' This setting in settings.py tells us that which
    template structure will be followed by the crispy_forms

8)  In order to use crispy forms in django we use ----{% load crispy_forms_tags %}----
    at top of template and just filter our form with crispy_form
    as-:

    {% form_name|crispy %}

9)  MEDIA_ROOT this is directory where in all the media files are stored

10) MEDIA_URL this is a url pointing to media base dir which can be used by django to
    know the url for a media

11) Django-Signals -> a django signal is python script that automatically fires after a
    expected task is performed(User cration in our case)
